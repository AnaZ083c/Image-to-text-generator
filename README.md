# image to text generator
This program can be launched in command line by simply typing: imgtxt picture.png 100
You have to be in the directory where imgtxt.py is located, otherwise it will not run.

An image can be any type, but it is recommended if its width is at least 150 pixels. The number that comes after the image argument is threshold which you need for the program to convert an image to an ASCII image.

The ASCII image is then saved as picture.txt. It is recommended that if you run it with notepad to set the font size to 1 if the picture is bigger, otherwise you can set the font size to 3 or 6.
